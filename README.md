# WIP

Everything here is currently being worked on.

# Installation

Make sure [git](https://git-scm.com) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) are installed, and then run

```
git clone https://github.com/ahmed-el-awad/senior-project-interface
```

to have a copy of the project locally.

## Run the client (web, mobile)

From the root directory, run

```
npm install
npm run start
```

To install the dependencies and start the development server. Now press `w` in the same terminal to open the website on web.
Alternatively you can run the application on mobile through [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) but for now, web is preferred for debugging.

## Run the (database) server

Refer to `server/README.md` for instructions on how to run the server for the database.

Note that both servers (the client and server) should be running together (each on separate terminals) if you want them to interact.
